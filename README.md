## Project Overview

This project we will examine how to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to provide safe connectivity between Amazon RDS and Amazon Glue. We should be able to execute Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations between Glue and RDS with ease, guaranteeing safe and effective data processing inside a VPC.

### Key Features:

- **Private Networking:** Ensure secure communication between Amazon Glue and Amazon RDS by setting up both services inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This allows all data transfer to occur over private subnets, isolating your traffic from the public internet and increasing data security.

- **Security Group and Subnet Control:** Configure security groups and subnets to tightly control inbound and outbound traffic between Glue and RDS. This feature allows you to restrict network access so that only Glue jobs can interact with the RDS instance, ensuring secure and efficient ETL processes.

- **Seamless ETL Operations:** Enable Amazon Glue to efficiently extract, transform, and load data from Amazon RDS by leveraging the VPC for smooth data flow. This setup ensures that your ETL operations are optimized for security and performance, allowing data to be processed within the protected boundaries of the VPC.
